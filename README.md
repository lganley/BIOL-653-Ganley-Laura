The typical workflow should consist of creating a .MD document in R Studio.  Once that is **SAVED** on my local computer it can be added to my github repository.  To do this I need to use the commands >block quote *git add name of file*, followed by *git commit -m'with a comment here'*, finally to get it up to the repo. *git push* (with no file name necessary at this point).  Git bash will likely ask for my github username and password at this point.
